# Slot-Game-RTP

The backbone of casino game mathematics is 'probability'. In this project, I have explained the underlying mathematics for the payout calculation of a real slot game. In order to develop the solution, the first game (Vegas Ca$h) in Slotomania, a popular social casino app, is used as an example. The same approach is applicable to any other slot game to calculate the Return to Player (RTP) for the game. The actual Vegas Ca$h game is very complex due to various features. Therefore, some of the features have been ignored in order to simplify the calculations, however, one can incorporate additional features into the game design once the foundational solution is developed. 

The code is developed in Python. All functions used in the notebook are defined in utility.py.
